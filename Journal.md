Decided the project idea's description and the required components ! I did several research on the component for the Mp3 POD and decided which of them are best and studied their pinouts and connections. Also Made a BOM

<h3>Log #2 (6/8/2025 IST)- 2 AND 1/2 HOURS</h3>
<br>
Made the schematic for the project and also decided a new feature of radio channels for the project. Although it is not included in the schematic as I am not sure how I can implement this but first is to make the core local storage music function then i'll be moving to the radio function to explore more.<br>
