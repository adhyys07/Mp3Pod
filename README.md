# Mp3 Pod
My Project name is Mp3Pod. It is pocket-sized mp3 player retrieving ipod memories.The project is based on Arduino Pro or a Arduino Nano which will be handling and the computing. I will soldering all things by myself although it can be made in a pcb style. The project will be having a audio jack for wired connectivity, 32 gb sized sd card to store 8000+ songs at a time, a bluetooth module to listen your favourite songs on your bluetooth devices, a fm radio module to listen your favourite radio fm channels. The project will be operated by a 300 MaH lipo battery. It will be having an OLED display to select specific songs or play-pause,to control the forward and previous of songs. To charge it there will be a c-type port to recharge it again and again

Note: I have 3D case planned for this project but first i need to build this project irl to get the exact dimensions and to get exact holes for the ports
